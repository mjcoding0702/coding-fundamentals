Question 1
Imagine we are asked to write "I love coding" 100 times. Writing it out one by one would be
a hassle. Hence, we write a short program to tell a robot to write "I love coding" for us.

But, the robot doesn't know when to stop. Hence, we add a counter variable and set it to stop
once it reaches 100.

Here's how you write a basic `for loop` in JavaScript:
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    //your code here will run 100 times
}


Question 2
- console.log() only shows you what you asked for. It doesn't bring actual changes
- return bring actual changes by storing/changing the result in/of a variable then display to user

Question 3
- truthy and falsy values are part of boolean data type.
- You can see them as "YES" or "NO"
- For example, when teacher asked you "Did you finished your homework"? Depending on your answer
  "YES" or "NO", you could get different result from your teacher! (Reward / Punishment)

Question 4
- Internet is a huge inter-connected network that connect millions of devices around the world
- Local area network (LAN) is a group of devices that communicate with each other in a 
  same geographical area
- Internet is basically a global network made of many LAN network, and it connects those LAN 
  network through standardized communication protocols.

Question 5
- A website is essentially a physical store in the internet.
- It has a domain name (store name), host server (a physical location), front-end that user 
  see (interior design), backend server or engine that user doesn't see (kitchen or workshop)
- So a typical walkthrough of a website would be something like this:
  - A customer visit a store located in a specific place, loved the environment inside, placed
    an order, the order is sent to the kitchen. Once order done, kitchen will send it back
    to service crew to be handed to customer.
  - A customer only needs to interact with the front-end (service crew), and get the result
    at the front-end as well. He/she doesn't need to worry what is happening at the back 
    of the store (website's backend)
